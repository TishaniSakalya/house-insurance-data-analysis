# 🏠 House Insurance Fraud Detection using MATLAB

A complete machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent insurance claims using MATLAB. This project includes exploratory data analysis, supervised learning (decision trees, KNN, SVM, random forest), and unsupervised learning (clustering).

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Explore patterns in house insurance claims
- Train multiple classification models to detect fraud
- Apply clustering to uncover hidden patterns

## 🛠 Methods
- **EDA:** Summary statistics, plots, outlier detection
- **Classification:** Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, Random Forest
- **Unsupervised:** K-means clustering

## 📁 Structure
- `/scripts/` – MATLAB scripts for analysis and modeling
- `/data/` – Includes dataset 
- `/reports/` – Final report and presentation slides

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- MATLAB 2015
